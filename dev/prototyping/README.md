Use this directory to store files that are not version-controlled. This is the directory to put a local copy of the quiz questions JSON file as well as the images of the quiz questions. The non-production version of the application contains a sample quiz data file located at `inst/app/quizfiles/quiz_questions_dev.json`. For details on how to initialize the necessary database tables, visit `dev/README.md`.
